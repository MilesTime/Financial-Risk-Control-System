# Financial-Risk-Control-System
Background:
The dynamic nature of financial markets and the proliferation of customer interactions have made real-time credit risk management essential for financial institutions. Static credit scoring systems fail to adapt to rapidly changing customer profiles, resulting in increased exposure to loan defaults and fraud.

Description:
Designed and implemented a real-time financial risk control system using LSTM and Graph Neural Network (GNN) models to enhance credit evaluation and risk monitoring. The system dynamically integrates multi-dimensional data sources, including transactional behavior, social network analysis, and payment histories. By applying LSTM for time-series data analysis and GNN for identifying risk relationships within customer networks, the solution provided continuous credit score updates. This innovative approach reduced loan losses by 15% and improved credit risk identification rates, enabling financial institutions to make informed lending decisions while minimizing risk exposure.
